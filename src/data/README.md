This folder holds data related the the Leeds Digital Festival

The data is held in two distinct areas:

- **services** - data which is not definitively tied to a specific instance of the festival. Twitter, website and mailing list data are examples of this kind of data.
- **festival** - data which only makes sense in the context of a given instance of the festival, such as organiser returns.
